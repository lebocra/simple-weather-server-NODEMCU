# simple-weather-server-NODEMCU
its the first time i make something with a nodeMCU and the absolute first time dealing with lua, so this is a convolution of example code and tutorials for making this
its basically made for me to curl into it for polybar, its not very polished but it works.
you'll use nodemcu-tool for uploading firmware and code, its pretty easy to use, all the code youll need is in ./src
